| 0.5.0        | solved the problem with negative numbers that came out of prantheses |
| 0.5.1        | extracting plus operation function from inside of calculator class to its outside |
| 0.6.0        | making a new automatic way to define operations from outside of the calculator class while adding a file keeping all of them as seperate modules |
| 0.6.1        | adding multiple , divide and power modules to operations file |
| 0.7.0        | changing calculation structure to calculate input by mathematical order |
| 0.7.1        | handled previous versions problem with parantheses |
| 0.7.2        | renaming bad named variables |
| 0.8.0        | solved problems with separated multiple parentheses |

| 1.2.0        | restructured interface file to OOP style |
| 1.3.0        | added advanced_interface class used by mod button to add functions into interface |
| 1.4.0        | replaced some buttons in advanced interface added some labels in advanced interface free space to show: number of solved problems / number of operations and functions used in last problem / an error if the syntax is wrong |
| 1.4.1        | added syntax error handling to simple interface |
| 1.4.2        | made a connection between simple interface and advanced interfaces memory(last done operations) |
| 1.4.3        | AC button now clears memory too |
| 1.5.0        | added new layer of buttons to the left of advanced interface including : 00 , MRC , M+ , M- , Auto Reply (reviews all done problems in memory each for 1 second ) |
| 1.5.1        | changed main flow to start and choose between interfaces (text,visual) from main file |
| 2.0.0        | added keyboard shortcuts for buttons in interface |
| 2.1.0        | added a menu  with a button countaining a window of shortcuts document |
| 2.2.0        | added pop ups for buttons to show key board short cuts of it when mouse comes in its area that are compatible with moving window around |
